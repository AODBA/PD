    "### What is Pandas and why we should learn Pandas ? \n",
    "\n",
    "  So Pandas comes from **Python Data Analysis Library**, and is maybe the most known python library for data analysis as it the name implies. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Why should we learn Pandas ?\n",
    "\n",
    " **Pandas is great for working with different types of data, such as:** \n",
    "- Tabular data with heterogeneously-typed columns, as in an SQL table or Excel spreadsheet.\n",
    "- Ordered and unordered (not necessarily fixed-frequency) time series data.\n",
    "- Arbitrary matrix data (homogeneously typed or heterogeneous) with row and column labels.\n",
    "- Any other form of observational / statistical data sets. The data actually need not be labeled at all to be placed into a pandas data structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "  **Here are just a few of the things that pandas does well:**\n",
    "- Easy handling of missing data (represented as NaN) in floating point as well as non-floating point data\n",
    "- Size mutability: columns can be inserted and deleted from DataFrame and higher dimensional objects\n",
    "- Automatic and explicit data alignment: objects can be explicitly aligned to a set of labels, or the user can simply ignore the labels and let Series, DataFrame, etc. automatically align the data for you in computations\n",
    "- Powerful, flexible group by functionality to perform split-apply-combine operations on data sets, for both aggregating and transforming data\n",
    "- Make it easy to convert ragged, differently-indexed data in other Python and NumPy data structures into DataFrame objects\n",
    "- Intelligent label-based slicing, fancy indexing, and subsetting of large data set\n",
    "- Intuitive merging and joining data sets\n",
    "- Flexible reshaping and pivoting of data sets\n",
    "- Hierarchical labeling of axes (possible to have multiple labels per tick)\n",
    "- Robust IO tools for loading data from flat files (CSV and delimited), Excel files, databases, and saving / loading data from the ultrafast HDF5 format\n",
    "- Time series-specific functionality: date range generation and frequency conversion, moving window statistics, date shifting and lagging.\n",
